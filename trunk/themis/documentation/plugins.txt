cache.so
This plugin, when requested via BMessage will search for and/or create cache files when so requested by the protocol. For instance, with the HTTP protocol plugin, if caching is enabled, cache.so will first seek any cache files that match the current URL, and if found, return an entry_ref to the calling object. If not, the HTTP protocol will download the page, and ask the cache plugin for an entry ref to store the data in.

http_plugin.so
This is the most basic and common protocol on the web. As of this writing, it can communicate with most servers well enough to pull down a web page and/or other resource, however, it is not yet complete.
