common/stripwhite.h
Added a new simple function for trimming white space off the start and end of a string.It returns a new'ed char * if successful,null if not.

common/tcplayer.*
Many ugly little changes to make the new http layer work correctly. Many new changes will need to be added and done before this is really ideal. Considering moving this to a shared library.

framework/app.cpp
Added a little bit of locking of the TCP layer.

modules/http/*
Massive changes. New locking system for both the HTTP layer and TCP layer protocols; most functions completely rewritten in the HTTP layer, including several brand new functions; code clarity is improved overall; chunked transfer encoding defeated once again. The HTTP protocol may now be considered reliable. It still has issues, but is much better overall.

General notes:
While the HTTP protocol has been greatly improved, it is not bug free. There is a definitely locking/deadlock issue that was introduced with these changes, however it's considered relatively minor. In addition, there is a new issue that apparently triggers extra connection structures to come into existance in  the TCP protocol layer. These sometimes crash the application on shutdown. Bugs will be filed for both of these known issues on the SourceForge project page (https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=13124&atid=113124 ) .

21 February 2002
========
Lots of little changes, and one big one that occurred a few days ago:

framework/DOM/*
Added the Document Object Model classes that Mark Hellegers has been working on.

Various project files
Updated to reflect new location of the binaries.

makefile
Updated to reflect the overnight addition of the new tcp/ip and http protocols.Not to mention the DOM and DOM test application.

modules/http/httplayer.cpp and httplayer.h
Various bug fixes, including one where the server would send the http header as it generated it rather than as a block of text. This caused a key variable to be NULL, and caused a crash.

========

makelinks.sh
All functionality removed.

framework/win.h framework/win.cpp
References to HTMLParser have been commented out. It has been causing compile errors for some strange reason.

makefile
Completely redone. See README.1ST for information. All other makefiles are to be removed.

README.1ST
Tasty tidbits added for flavoring.

17 June 2001
========

makelinks.sh
Added new links for plugclass.cpp to both the cache and http modules.

common/commondefs.h
Added new protocol specific command values.

common/plugclass.cpp common/plugclass.h
Changed the Cancel variable from int8 to int32, and added a Stop function that uses atomic_add to change the value of Cancel.

documentation/plugin_api.txt
Updated (as in added some of the necessary info to) this file so that others may begin hacking away on plugins properly.

framework/app.cpp
The QuitRequested function will now wait for the PluginManager to die properly. This will ensure that the plugins are unloaded prior to the application quitting. This should potentially eliminate some memory leaks.

framework/plugman.cpp
The QuitRequested function will now call UnloadAllPlugins with the "clean" parameter set to true to unload every last plugin loaded. Also corrected the plugin load portion of MessageReceived to properly mark in memory plugins as being in memory.

framework/winview.cpp framework/winview.h
Made the stop button a little more permanent; it's still in an arbitrary location at the moment, but it now has a class wide pointer variable. There is also some testing code commented out in the MessageReceived function.

modules/http/http_defines.h
Changed the plugin version number, added two internal command values.

modules/http/http_main.cpp modules/http/http_main.h
Massive changes. Added license to the cpp file. Added new class http_worker which will perform http transactions in separate threads. The main http_protocol thread is now simply a manager for the http_worker class; it accepts new requests through a port called "http_protocol_port" and creates new http_workers to handle the transactions. See http_protocol::GetURL() for information on how to create appropriate messages to generate http_workers.
