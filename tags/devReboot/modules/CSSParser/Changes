- added "width", "height"

***** 7.4.2001, axeld. *****
- added "letter-spacing", "word-spacing"

- added "white-space", "background-repeat", "background-attachment"
- added "font-variant", "font-style", "font-weight"
- PropertyParser::ParseLength() couldn't handle numbers without a unit
- added "border-(left|top|right|bottom)-width"
- added URL parsing and "background-image"
- import string/url will now be parsed (but nothing happens so far)

***** 12.4.2001, axeld. *****
- renamed LengthValue to UnitValue, ParseLength() to ParseUnit(), etc.
- added CSS2 units: times (ms/s), angles (deg/rad/grad), frequencies (Hz/kHz)
- units were case sensitive
- begun extended at-rule handling (necessary for CSS2)

***** 13.4.2001, axeld. *****
- moved comment handling to StyleSheetParser::SkipWhiteSpaces(), renamed to
  NextToken()

***** 16.4.2001, axeld. *****
- reworked block handling; blocks can now be nested, which is required for
  CSS2 (well, and for being a "future compatible" CSS1 parser as well)
- at-rules are now allowed everywhere (except @import)
- AtRuleParser::Parse() now skips unknown rules until ';' or '{'
- StyleSheetParser::SkipString() & PropertyParser::ParseString() are now
  able to handle escaped newlines

***** 17.4.2001, axeld. *****
- the form-feed (12/0x0c) and carriage return (13/0x0d) haven't been recognized
  as white space characters
- @charset is ignored when it's not in the first line of the stylesheet

***** 18.4.2001, axeld. *****
- fixed a memory leak in AtRuleParser::Parse()
- PropertyParser::ParseKeywordOrUnit() could have problems with units (and the
  absence of them)
- complete rewrite of the selector parsing; it now (hopefully completely) complies
  to the CSS2 grammar
- added CSS2 display property values

***** 19.4.2001, axeld. *****
- reworked handling of set/important flag setting, property parsing is simpler now
- the keyword "inherit" is now accepted for every property
- "border-color" now accepts "transparent" (CSS2)
- all known CSS2 properties will now be recognized (but only some of them parsed, though)
- StyleSheetParser::fBeginAtRule wasn't properly initialized
- fixed all "-Wall" warnings
- empty selectors are now deleted
- added shorthand properties "margin", "padding", "border-width"
- "border-color" didn't use the correct method of filling in missing values
- added "border-(top|right|bottom|left)-color" properties
- PropertyParser::ParseKeyword() returned INVALID_VALUE if the keyword was immediately
  followed by the end of line
- added "border-(top|right|bottom|left)-style" & "border-style" properties
- added "border-(top|right|bottom|left)" & "border" shorthand properties

***** 21.4.2001, axeld. *****
- added "float", "clear", "background-position"
- reworked the parsing of properties which only accept a keyword from a defined
  list of keywords
- added "border-collapse", "caption-side", "direction", "empty-cells",
  "font-stretch", "list-style-position", "list-style-type", "overflow",
  "page-break-after", "page-break-before", "page-break-inside",
  "position", "speak", "speak-header", "speak-numeral", "speak-punctuation",
  "table-layout", "unicode-bidi", "visibility"
- :lang pseudo class is now parsed correctly incl. the "(x)" language suffix
- AtRuleParser::Parse() used wrong delimiter ('}', instead of '{') for invalid
  or unknown at-rules
- replaced fMode by fImportAllowed, since it had no other meaning anymore

***** 22.4.2001, axeld. *****
- added "list-style-image"
- since PropertyParser::ParseString() & PropertyParser::ParseLongName() use a fixed
  buffer size, strings/names which exceeds the currently 512 bytes are skiped
- added "font-family"
- "font-weight" no longer accepts other numbers than "100", "200", ..., "900"
- added "font", "list-style" & "background" shorthand properties; parsing of CSS1
  properties is now complete
- the parser is now fully CSS1 compliant

***** 25.4.2001, axeld. *****
- added box offsets "left", "right", "top", and "bottom"
- "font-size-adjust" and "font-stretch" weren't initialized from within the "font"
  property
- added "font-size-adjust"
- added extra system color keywords
- added "outline-width", "outline-color", "outline-style"
- added "z-index", "widows", "orphans", "marker-offset"
- added "min-width", "min-height", and "max-width", "max-height"
- added "page" property

***** 7.5.2001, axeld. *****
- Properties class member "outlineStyle" was missing (data were overwritten...)
- added "outline", "border-spacing", "quotes", "marks", "clip"
- added "counter-reset", "counter-increment" (they are not updating an existing
  counter yet)
- added "cursor", "size", "text-shadow", "content"

***** 10.5.2001, axeld. *****
- Counters are now stored in a hash table, incrementing is now working
- since the Property class is not so simple anymore, it will be moved after
  parsing, not copied
- "text-align" was not CSS2 compliant
- all system colors are now defined (for BeOS), but they are not always that
  useful
- the property parser is now fully CSS2 compliant (without aural properties)

***** 11.5.2001, axeld. *****
- Hashtable::~Hashtable() did not free the entire hash
- the class Properties is now one big structure and not divided into
  BoxProperties, BackgroundProperties, ... (it's now 644 bytes long)

***** 13.5.2001, axeld. *****
- Hashtable::MakeEmpty() can now free or delete entry's keys and values

ToDo:
- add support for different media types
- add parsing of all at-rules left
- check for possible memory leaks
- parsing of aural properties 4/20 (CSS2:aural)??
- PropertyParser::ParseString() & PropertyParser::ParseLongName() use a fixed buffer
  size of 512 bytes (longer names/strings will be skipped)
- add escaped characters & the full latin1 codes to name scanning
- supports only single byte encodings
- property order is not represented right now (but has to be for determining the
  cascading order
- rewrite InputStream since it is dog slow (grrr)!
- rewrite with a clear distinction between scanner, parser, etc. ?
